# VPN Connection Manager

## Overview

This VPN Connection Manager is a bash script that incorporates latency measurements to determine and connect to the best VPN service on your system. By checking the response time to a common host (`Google: 8.8.8.8` or `Cloudflare: 1.1.1.1`), the script selects the VPN service with the lowest latency, optimizing network performance.

## Features

- Measures latency for each configured VPN service.
- Selects and connects to the VPN service with the lowest latency.
- Logs latency measurements and connection status, offering insights into VPN performance.

## Prerequisites

- Bash shell
- `systemctl` for VPN service management
- `ping` for latency measurement
- Configured VPN services on your system

## Usage

1. Update the `vpn_services` array with your VPN service names.
2. Set `test_host` to a reliable host for latency measurement (default is `8.8.8.8`).

To deploy the script:

1. Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x vpn-connection-manager.sh
```

2. Run the script:

```bash
./vpn-connection-manager.sh
```

## How It Works

- For each VPN service, the script temporarily starts the service and measures the latency by pinging a predefined host.
- It compares the latency values and selects the VPN service with the lowest response time.
- The script then permanently connects to the best VPN service and stops others, ensuring optimal performance.

## Expanding the Script

- Integrate with a monitoring tool to continuously track VPN latency and automatically switch to the best service.
- Add error handling for scenarios where the `ping` command might be blocked or unreliable.
- Consider additional metrics such as packet loss or jitter for selecting the best VPN service.

This advanced script optimizes VPN connections based on latency, ensuring enhanced network performance and reliability.
